## You look lost

Hi there! I'm George, a weeb and student of computer science and engineering. I work with Javascript and Typescript a lot, and also like Ruby, Python, and Swift. I'm experienced with frontend and backend, and especially enjoy frontend design. I also enjoy photography, video games, and bad music.

## Experience

- I'm a maintainer of [toolbox for reddit](https://github.com/toolbox-team), a browser extension which gives reddit moderators more tools to make their lives easier
- I created [Yuuko](/yuuko/), a Discord bot framework based on [Eris](https://github.com/abalabahaha/eris)
- I wrote [reddit-stylesheet-sync](https://github.com/Geo1088/reddit-stylesheet-sync), a Travis config that lets subreddit style authors write Sass on GitHub and have it automatically compiled, minified, and uploaded to their sub
- I designed and maintained [/r/anime's CSS theme](https://github.com/r-anime/stylesheet) for several years
- [...And a bunch more](https://github.com/Geo1088?tab=repositories)
