## You look lost

Hi there! I'm George, a student of computer science and engineering. I create web applications, API consumers, automation scripts, and hobby electronics projects with technologies including Node.js, Vue, Typescript, Ruby, Python, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi. I'm especially interested in user-facing design and various frontend development strategies. My other hobbies include photography, hiking, and casual gaming.

## Experience

- I'm a maintainer of [toolbox for reddit](https://github.com/toolbox-team), a browser extension which gives reddit moderators more tools to make their lives easier
- I created [Yuuko](/yuuko/), a lightweight Discord bot framework for Node.js
- I wrote [reddit-stylesheet-sync](https://github.com/Geo1088/reddit-stylesheet-sync), a Travis config that lets subreddit style authors write Sass on GitHub and have it automatically compiled, minified, and uploaded to their sub
- I designed and currently maintain [/r/anime's CSS theme](https://github.com/r-anime/stylesheet)
- [And more!](https://github.com/Geo1088?tab=repositories)
