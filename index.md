## You look lost

Hi there! I'm George, a high-school code monkey and casual weeb that does a bunch of random stuff. I primarily work in Javascript and also have a passable understanding of Python and Ruby. I'm a moderator of [/r/anime](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime), and I also enjoy photography, video games, and bad music.

## Projects

- Maintainer of [toolbox for reddit](https://github.com/toolbox-team), a browser extension which gives reddit moderators more tools to make their lives easier
- Created [Yuuko](https://github.com/Geo1088/yuuko), a Discord bot for developers, whose base is available as an npm package
- Wrote [reddit-stylesheet-sync](https://github.com/Geo1088/reddit-stylesheet-sync), a Travis config that lets subreddit style authors write Sass on GitHub and have it automatically compiled, minified, and uploaded to their sub
- Wrote a [crappy IRC to Discord bridge](https://github.com/Geo1088/irc-discord) that allows me to use Snoonet without needing a dedicated IRC client
- Designed [/r/anime's CSS theme](https://github.com/r-anime/stylesheet)
- [...And a bunch more](https://github.com/Geo1088?tab=repositories)
