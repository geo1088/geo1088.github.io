I've been on the server since it was opened to the user base on reddit. </p><h2>Why do you want to be a Discord chat mod?</h2> <p>I'd like to become a Discord chat mod because I believe it would be beneficial for one of the other regulars to help moderate #general. Not many people are willing to tolerate or talk to the people in the channel and so I'd like to just help out a little more by becoming a chat mod.<br>
<br>
I'd also prefer for the chat to calm down in some spots when it gets a little too far. Those are the moments where other mods may not be able to reach in time because of timezones or not looking at chat. I'd be able to stop it quite quickly since I'm on the channel a fair bit and respond to pings fast. </p><h2>Is there any part of the discord server you'd like to change?

I think I could help control #general since mods don't want to go there for the most part. Also I think I have some decent ideas and feedback that might help others. </p><h2>Is there any part of the discord server you'd like to change? Rule change or new proposal for example.</h2> <p>I would like to a possible streamline re-watches or group watches on the discord. I would be a nice place for people to share not so main stream shows/movies and to have a good time. </p><h2>Past experience (if applicable)</h2> <p>I use to run a runescape clan for about 4 years, I know this isn't 100% in line with moderating a discord but I had to handle a lot of the same things. Issues between member's, enforcing of rules etc. Its run similar but just with anime instead of runescape.</p><h2>This time around we're looking for people to actively moderate the spoiler channels and US nighttime in #general, can you do this?</h2> <p>Yes</p><h2>Where are you from/What timezone are you most active in?</h2> <p>CST, although i'm mainly up from 3pm-6am</p><h1>Thrasher#0557</h1><h2>Tell us about yourself</h2> <p>I'm a 26 year old university graduate who has spent way too much time watching anime and yet tragically still haven't spent enough time for it to become a super power, I'm not half bad when it comes to video games either. I've got a relatively jovial personality and enjoy messing around a bit when appropriate. Outside of that there's really nothing particularly interesting to say.</p><h2>Why do you want to be a Discord chat mod?</h2> <p>I've been part of the server since it was first created and in that time have been witness to a lot of occasions when the general behavior of a channel has derailed via misconduct of a single user or due to the posting of spoilers and while the current team already do an exceptional job of handling it, believe that with the general knowledge I have of a variety of different series as well as a calm demeanor would be able to assist in such occasions.<br>
<br>
In addition to that however there's the specific cases of the spoiler channels where despite their use being geared towards anime only discussions, frequently can result in minor to severe thoughtless spoilers by source readers that depending on the severity of them could very well go unnoticed without someone who can keep a close eye so the experience won't be ruined for those unfamiliar with the source material. And then there is #general in and of itself. Though I do not frequent it in any sort of consistent manner I am familiar with the general culture and having spent a significant number of years on 4chan would be able to pretty much handle anything I would have to come across while modding it, nothing in that channel is worse than how /b/ can and has gotten in the past.</p><h2>Is there any part of the discord server you'd like to change? Rule change or new proposal for example.</h2> <p>I think the general attitude around the place can get a bit too hostile at times, particularly in regards to the way opinions are shared among users and ideally I'd like to be able to work to reduce that a bit, so we don't have to have minor little confrontations that happen from time to time. One example being the 3-gatsu channel after the latest episode. But I'm also aware that it's nigh impossible to truly go about fixing such behavior.<br>
<br>
What I do think would be interesting to do however is if we were to bring in something akin to scheduled official rewatches. Could make a poll once each season for a few 1-2 cour series and leave a dedicated channel for users to discuss it amongst themselves similar to how the Texhnolyze rewatch worked</p><h2>Past experience (if applicable)</h2> <p>I'm a submod of a few minor subreddits one of which resulted in a little discord channel drama I had to clean up recently, but outside of that nothing.</p><h2>This time around we're looking for people to actively moderate the spoiler channels and US nighttime in #general, can you do this?</h2> <p>Yes</p><h2>Where are you from/What timezone are you most active in?</h2> <p>I'm from Australia, but I'm basically avaiable for like 20 hours a day, hence why I'm still around filling this out at 5am my own time.

(i also post fairly frequently on the sub.)</p><h2>Why do you want to be a Discord chat mod?</h2> <p>thanks to joining the discord i have found the place that i enjoy spending my time discussing these hobbies more than anywhere else. i really like the community we have, and value the way that the active but relatively hands-off moderation works & sets the tone for the server. i'm a very active poster, and find that sometimes moderation ends up being lacking in spoiler channels for one reason or another, whether that's in terms of arguments that get over-the-top, or unmarked spoilers left up for a while. folks aren't always around to deal with this stuff, and i feel like with the amount of time i spend with the server open & checking spoiler channels, i'd be relatively well-equipped to deal with these situations.</p><h2>Is there any part of the discord server you'd like to change? Rule change or new proposal for example.</h2> <p>in terms of rules, there's nothing in particular i'd feel is absolutely necessary to have. i think that the pinned message regarding toxicity in #anime would be worth extending to spoiler channels as well, though.</p><h2>Past experience (if applicable)</h2> <p>nothing on the scale of discord moderation experience, but i'm pretty familiar with how the discord works at this point.</p><h2>This time around we're looking for people to actively moderate the spoiler channels and US nighttime in #general, can you do this?</h2> <p>i'm happy to be on-call for #general, but i myself spend a lot of time in spoiler channels, and feel that tighter moderation in them would be a huge asset.</p><h2>Where are you from/What timezone are you most active in?</h2> <p>usa/est</p><h1>Vincent</h1><h2>Tell us about yourself</h2> <p>Hey there!<br>
I'm a 21 year old IT student from the Middle East, specifically Iraq. I've been in the server since day 1 (besides that one time I took a break for a few days) and I've become an active part of the community in the different spoiler chats as well as #anime. My hobbies are reading, writing, basketball and chess. I'm not the most outgoing, but I am a straight A student, so I'd say my non-outgoing nature is paying off in other ways :)</p><h2>Why do you want to be a Discord chat mod?</h2> <p>As I mentioned above, I've been here for a long time and have been integrating myself into the community as much as I could, taken my part in some arguments over in the meta channel, as well developed an understanding of how the server functions and how different users approach it. My aim is to use that knowledge to better the server and slowly but surely make it into a more peaceful, newbie-friendly zone that no one would ever feel alien in.</p><h2>Is there any part of the discord server you'd like to change? Rule change or new proposal for example.</h2> <p>Honestly, I'd increase the visibility of doled out punishments because rather than simply banning or muting a user, making them an example in front of others goes a long way into improving the general understanding of the rules and how lax or otherwise they may be.</p><h2>Past experience (if applicable)</h2> <p>No such thing, really. Besides some arabic anime forum moderation nearly 6 years ago, I've stayed away from moderation jobs in general. As for Discord, no experience moderating to speak of.</p><h2>This time around we're looking for people to actively moderate the spoiler channels and US nighttime in #general, can you do this?</h2> <p>I believe I can do a good job moderating both #anime and the spoiler channels as I'm familiar with most of the people there, but I don't believe I'd be fit for moderating general as I'm completely unfamiliar with the users or their established culture.</p><h2>Where are you from/What timezone are you most active in?</h2> <p>5 am EST to 5 pm EST, subject to change on weekends.</p><h1>Apiks#3656</h1><h2>Tell us about yourself</h2> <p>I’ve been a huge fan of anime for the past ten years and have gotten to 140+ days on MAL. Just about to turn 20 and starting university with software engineering.<br>
<br>
The past summer I started studying Japanese as it is one of my dreams to be able to read Light and Visual Novels in Japanese. I like playing video games with people from the Discord when I’m not watching anime. I hope to soon delve into older anime as I’ve consumed most modern shows.</p><h2>Why do you want to be a Discord chat mod?</h2> <p>I believe that spoilers most definitely have no space on the server and would like to help in managing them as well as running some mod-sponsored events that I will outline in the next section. It is also of note that while banter is not a bad thing, it sometimes gets out of hand and heated. Emotions fly and it has to be managed. General-serious in particular has some periods of this due to the nature of its conversational topic.<br>
<br>
I keep a pretty big eye on at least half of seasonal shows so I can watch spoiler channels too. I visit #general fairly often as well and think I know when things are just friendly banter or getting aggressive.&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be a mod because after watching this server grow for so long I want to take an active hand in managing it.</p><h2>Is there any part of the discord server you'd like to change? Rule change or new proposal for example.</h2> <p>The current set of rules are good. If anything the only thing lacking in the rule-handling regard is manpower since I sometimes see no sub or chat mods online to moderate it, or if any, only one or two, a number unimpressive in handling all the channels on the server.<br>
<br>
Something I’d be interested in proposing and even handling would be discord events. An actual example of this would be Voi and I organizing over the course of October movie-watching sessions with a multitude of people from the discord and keeping a steady schedule that fits everybody’s needs for more than two weeks. More than half a dozen of movies have been seen in this manner.<br>
<br>
Other suggestions may lie in the area of browser or forum games that may be run on the discord at designated times. Possibly also anime watches/rewatches in real time, maybe with the use of a program like Syncplay or an online alternative.</p><h2>Past experience (if applicable)</h2> <p>None for Discord.

I am not sure what to do yet after graduation, but what I do know is that I am enjoying learning this subject. A positive attribute that I have includes having a knack for organization. I love to see the space around me brimming with neatness and everything being in place, because it aesthetically pleases me. A negative attribute that I have though that I want to get fixed is that I have procrastination issues. I am currently working on it though, especially now that I am a college student where every second that passes is very important. With regards to anime, I have been watching the medium since I was a kindergartener due to living in the Philippines, where anime is prevalent. I migrated to the States 7 years ago because of my parents’ job, and because of that I had a year gap in watching some anime because there is less accessibility here than in the Philippines. Some of my favorite series include the monogatari series, the index series (not including railgun or accelerator), and oregairu. I also enjoy reading some manga, and my favorite is “the world god only knows”. I do have a lot of shows on my backlog, and I hope to get to them if I have free time. I have also enjoyed building some gunplas. Outside of anime, some of my interests include games and keeping up with pro basketball and football.</p><h2>Why do you want to be a Discord chat mod?</h2> <p>I want to become one because the discord community is a place where I can talk about my interests with other people who has the same interest. Although it sounds uncanny, I kind of consider it another home for me because I have had some great conversations with other people on this server. On modding, I do want to become one because I want to become a part of the team who has been keeping the chat a fun place to talk about a lot of stuff. I am aware that it is quite the task, especially for me who does not have experience from other servers, but I am willing to take on such challenges. I will admit that there has been times when the r/anime server has just started where I was a bit naughty along with other users. I’ve learned my lesson though, and it’s become more annoying to me than fun just watching that unfold. But that’s not to say that I don’t like fun, in fact just following conversations unfold in #general most of the time give me a good laugh. I admit I have been quite inactive lately, but that is due to me getting used to the college landscape, and increased time socializing with other friends. But on the flip side I also want to become more involved with the community.</p><h2>Is there any part of the discord server you'd like to change? Rule change or new proposal for example.</h2> <p>I don’t think I would change anything, really. I thought that the last rule was intriguing for me, but I thought of some instances where it could turn nasty for someone seeking help in such a server like this, especially in general where someone can easily mistake some other person’s actions easily.</p><h2>Past experience (if applicable)</h2> <p>I do not have past experience modding a huge server, but I used to have a server that I made for my school’s anime club. That server became dead after a week though because no one went online due to their unfamiliarity with the site and being busy with school.</p><h2>This time around we're looking for people to actively moderate the spoiler channels and US nighttime in #general, can you do this?</h2> <p>The latest on any given day is 2:30 am pst</p><h2>Where are you from/What timezone are you most active in?</h2> <p>PST Timezone</p><h1>Bubble#6019</h1><h2>Tell us about yourself</h2> <p>I usually go by Bubble, and my reddit username is /u/BloodyBubble.

I play video games in between my studies, and work with group chats I’ve created for certain academic courses. </p><h2>Why do you want to be a Discord chat mod?</h2> <p>I’m hoping to put some of my free time to good use by supporting communities and discords made for certain mediums that I am well acquainted with. I hate to see discords that are full of potential ruined by either the members or staff in it, and hope to help prevent that by any means. I love to get involved in different discords by joining discussions found in certain channels. The chance to become a moderator for the different anime spoilers channels is a wonderful opportunity in and of itself. If any more questions are needed of me i’ll do my best to respond as swiftly as possible. </p><h2>Is there any part of the discord server you'd like to change? Rule change or new proposal for example.</h2> <p>Just like we currently have a limited time spoiler channel for certain seasonal anime, I believe there should be an affiliated type channel allowing other subreddit based discord communities of seasonal anime to get their spotlight. For instance if a member enjoys an anime such as Made in Abyss, and they still want to have conversations with other fans of the show about that topic, it’d be hard for them to talk about it if they’re only active in the r/anime discord community and the seasonal anime chats are changed for each according season. If we put out a certain member limit, for instance the seasonal anime discord or just anime discord doesn’t have x amount of members, then they will be deemed as unable to qualify for a affiliation at that specific timeframe. This also allows the r/anime discord to receive attention by being affiliated with anime discord servers. </p><h2>Past experience (if applicable)</h2> <p>Admin for the Shoujo Shuumatsu Ryoko subreddit and discord, Administrative influence on public game servers for games such as Garry’s Mod, and other influences on certain anime affiliated discords. </p><h2>This time around we're looking for people to actively moderate the spoiler channels and US nighttime in #general, can you do this?</h2> <p>Yes</p><h2>Where are you from/What timezone are you most active in?</h2> <p>California, PST, 4 pm PST to 11 pm PST</p><h1>Ravyn82#2604</h1><h2>Tell us about yourself</h2> <p>Married, full time job, love anime</p><h2>Why do you want to be a Discord chat mod?</h2> <p>I’d would be great to help out and make sure the channel runs smoothly</p><h2>Is there any part of the discord server you'd like to change?

I'm Kadius, long time anime fan and general friendly person! uwu I really like the community on your server in the while I've been here and would love to help raise it into the best possible server it could be!</p><h2>Why do you want to be a Discord chat mod?</h2> <p>I really like looking out for people and making sure no one as said, plus having my hand in the future of a server is a very fulfilling feeling that not many other things can quite reach the same level of gratification.</p><h2>Is there any part of the discord server you'd like to change? Rule change or new proposal for example.</h2> <p>I think Rule 12 is honestly silly. For some people, this community might be all they have so putting a blockade onto letting them seek emotional support might leave them with no one to talk to which can lead to a pretty bad emotional state. I don't know the back story for Rule 12, I assume since it is the latest rule on the list it was probably added due to a bad experience, and that's fair. However I think it should be tweaked to allow people to talk about themselves a bit more without making other people uncomfortable.</p><h2>Past experience (if applicable)</h2> <p>I have moderation experience with a lot of League of Legends discords, not much else though. They are, obviously, the same thing though as they come down to managing a community. I have modded for RivenMains, YasuoMains and Kha'ZixMains, have Administrator experience in RengarMains, have ownership experience with KledMains and previously, before I changed ownership and resigned because running 2 big servers is stressful, owned TaliyahMains. Most of these servers had ~1000 members in them and a decently active chat. RivenMains, the server I most actively moderate these days, has around 3000 members. In the past I have also done moderation for servers in Minecraft, Terraria and GMod. Due to this I have a very experienced attitude towards conflicts and can resolve most conflicts very soundly and wish to develop that skill further as a moderator.</p><h2>This time around we're looking for people to actively moderate the spoiler channels and US nighttime in #general, can you do this?</h2> <p>Yes</p><h2>Where are you from/What timezone are you most active in?</h2> <p>Australia, GMT+9:30.

I'm the Loli Connoisseur. I've been watching anime for about 9 years now give or take. I'm open to watching absolutely anything (especially loli shows) as long as it's enjoyable and constantly piques my interest. I do like discussing and sharing my thoughts and interests of it with other fellow anime fans, as it is my favorite hobby, and there's really no other medium like it that gives me the same experience that I can consume. It's always nice to hear other people's enthusiasm and ideas about it and that's something I've always liked.<br>
<br>
Games is also another hobby of mine ever since I was small, and I've been doing it far longer compared to anime. I've spent god knows how long playing it over the course of my life, and FPS is definitely my favorite genre. My go to games right now however are PUBG, osu!, and a bit of Overwatch from time to time.<br>
<br>
As for IRL stuff, I'm a college student in Toronto and will start studying again this coming January as I'm going to learn Computer Programming & Analysis and I'm really looking forward to that! I also recently just got a job in my local cinema which I'm really happy about. It's a bit hectic at times, but it allows me to pay off my student loans, help my parents pay for the house, and eat some tasty food (and buy all the loli figs from amiami finally :ginsan:)<br>
<br>
I'm also a firm believer that traps are gay.</p><h2>Why do you want to be a Discord chat mod?</h2> <p>I've been here since the start of the server and is really the only reason why I use discord. It's always one of the first things I like to check when I open my computer. I invest a good amount of time chatting and lurking in, so I might as well give it a shot and try to moderate the server while I'm at it. I believe I can contribute to the server and I want to be able to give back something to the anime community no matter how small it may be. I've always liked the idea of moderating, making sure people follow the rules, and moderating one of my favorite communities while simultaneously discussing my biggest passion with others is something I would love to do.</p><h2>Is there any part of the discord server you'd like to change? Rule change or new proposal for example.</h2> <p>As far as I'm aware, this rule is only pinned in #general and really only happens in #general, but I think hate towards new users should be a server-wide rule and not only in that channel. I will admit of being guilty of this, but calling a newfag and outrate hate on new users makes the server extremely unwelcoming and really discourages people from joining. Additionally, it also gives new people a wrong idea of how the r/anime community is and gives us this toxic cloud above our heads. I know most people just say it as a meme or joke, but new users could potentially take it seriously and I think not much is being done about it right now. Other than that however, I think the current set of rules cover everything else.<br>
<br>
Other than rules, one change I would like to suggest is create a dedicated channel where users can submit server emotes for mods to vote on. I think it's just a hassle scrolling through meta concerns finding emote suggestions while being mixed along with a whole bunch of other meta-concern related things. Having one channel dedicated to emote suggestions should make this significantly easier.</p><h2>Past experience (if applicable)</h2> <p>I've moderated an osu! discord server in the past which roughly had around 100 users.</p><h2>This time around we're looking for people to actively moderate the spoiler channels and US nighttime in #general, can you do this?</h2> <p>Yes</p><h2>Where are you from/What timezone are you most active in?</h2> <p>Canada, Eastern timezone.

I'm 25 and I've watched anime for the better part of my life, though I've occasionally burned out on the medium. I joined the discord just to find people to talk anime with, and that's exactly what I found.</p><h2>Why do you want to be a Discord chat mod?</h2> <p>I've grown to appreciate the server a lot since I joined it, and I want to help out a little myself. Every now and then I watch discussions get out of hand, and there's not always mods around to keep the chat civil enough.<br>
<br>
I'm already active in most of the spoiler channels, including the more or less dead ones. While I don't frequent #general often, I'm not opposed to keeping an eye out whenever needed.</p><h2>Is there any part of the discord server you'd like to change? Rule change or new proposal for example.</h2> <p>The server is solid as is, but I feel a few things could be tweaked. A general spoiler channel, or one exclusively for anime, could have some value. Spoiler discussions are sometimes avoided entirely, and at other times held while clumsily trying to avoid what technically counts as spoilers. A spoiler channel would require clear rules and firm as well as active moderation, but I feel it could be worth an experiment.<br>
<br>
One other thing I would like to see is more interaction between the subreddit and discord, which are quite divided most of the time. One way to achieve that could be to facilitate discussion channels for currently running rewatches, providing a platform for those who want to discuss in detail. With the high amount of rewatches in progress that may be difficult however.</p><h2>Past experience (if applicable)</h2> <p>I've been a long time moderator and admin on the Monster Hunter wiki forum, though it has been practically dead for a while now.</p><h2>This time around we're looking for people to actively moderate the spoiler channels and US nighttime in #general, can you do this?</h2> <p>Just Spoiler Channels</p><h2>Where are you from/What timezone are you most active in?</h2> <p>I'm located at GMT+1, and I'm usually active on discord from 8 AM to about 2 AM, depending on the day. </p><h1>MilitaryUniformPrincess#9835</h1><h2>Tell us about yourself</h2> <p>AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH<br>
