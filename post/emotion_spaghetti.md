# In which I try to describe my current mental state

## You guys have changed me for the better and that's awesome

My experience with you all has been so many things - Fun, exciting, difficult, boring, upsetting, emotional, joyous, relieving, heartbreaking, faith-restoring... You name it, I've felt it here. Spending the last year and change (depending on when I met you) with you guys has been an honor, a privilege, and an absolute blast, and I wouldn't trade it for anything in toe world.

Y'all have shown me a *lot* of things. Today, as I look back over this time in my life, I can't help but wonder how I changed the way I have. I started out here being a little depressed about my parents getting divorced and letting that seep too much into the rest of my life, making it hard for me to find any motivation for anything what I was doing - school, personal projects, even things I really enjoyed like watching anime or even talking with people. And now I'm definitely over the divorce and fighting back the last signs of my school troubles, while at the same time talking to you guys way more. It just feels great to know that I'm making progress - even if it's not coming fast, I can feel that I've become a significantly more positive, outgoing, caring person, and that's all I could ever ask for.

## Honoka still shows me what I want to be

The "Honoka giving up on being an idol" thing is probably the most overused reference to the series among us, but honestly, seeing her in that moment and afterwards symbolizes the kind of person I want to be. I want to be the kind of person who shows their happiness and uses it to cheer others up and on, but I know there will be times when I fall behind and let things get to me too much. When times like that happen, I want to be able to rely on others to help me. I want to be able to have a goal that I can work towards so I can set my sights on that when I fall behind.

## My mind is asjdfhjsgjd

Now, here's how I feel about myself right now.

I'm okay with giving up, and I can live with failure, as long as I have a next step. I want to look at where I want to be and take the path there one step at a time. If I stumble or fall along the way, so be it - I can keep stumbling and falling as long as I live, as long as I still move forward. And even if I come to a standstill or even go backwards, I want to keep fighting my way around the obstacles without losing sight of my goal.

The problem with this is, right now, I don't have any kind of goal. I'm determined to improve myself, but I don't really have anything specific to work towards. I can count my shortcomings, but I don't see the motivation in myself to accomplish anything significant. The thing I care most about is helping others, and not only does that goal really only work on the small scale, it can make it harder to help myself.

And yet for now, I think I'm okay with that. I've still become a better person through my interactions with you, and I've had my share of times I had to help someone else. Things are trending up for me so far, and I want to take that and ride it as far as I can.

But in all honesty, I have no fucking idea what I just said. Trying to describe my thoughts is like having a mechanic do heart surgery. There's just so much there that I'm feeling so intensely that it's almost impossible to break down. All I know for sure is that I'm far from perfect and I want to help people, and I want to act on both of those somehow.

## In conclusion, there is no conclusion

I don't know what else to say honestly. I feel like I'm leaving something out, but I don't think that's an issue for now - I'll just end up feeling something else tomorrow anyway, there's always gonna be more to say. I just hope that you, the people who have brought me this far, will let me follow you into the future, and that going forward I can do my part in helping where I can too.
